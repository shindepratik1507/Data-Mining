Consider the following observations/data. And apply simple linear regression and find
out estimated coefficients b0 and b1.( use numpypackage)
x=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13]
y = ([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12,16, 18]




import numpy as np

# Given data
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13])
y = np.array([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18])

# Calculate the means of x and y
x_mean = np.mean(x)
y_mean = np.mean(y)

# Calculate the terms needed for the numerator and denominator of b1
numerator = np.sum((x - x_mean) * (y - y_mean))
denominator = np.sum((x - x_mean) ** 2)

# Calculate coefficients b1 (slope) and b0 (intercept)
b1 = numerator / denominator
b0 = y_mean - b1 * x_mean

print(f"Estimated coefficients:")
print(f"b0 (intercept) = {b0}")
print(f"b1 (slope) = {b1}")
